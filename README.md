# Docker Puppeteer

A Node + Puppeteer base image for running Puppeteer scripts. Add your own tools (such as Jest, Mocha, etc), link services you want to test via Docker Compose, and run your Puppeteer scripts with a headless Chromium.

Forked from https://github.com/buildkite/docker-puppeteer so I could use a newer node version.
